## Getting Started

> By Default: **This plugin relies on [`react-native-device-info`](https://github.com/rebeccahughes/react-native-device-info). You must install and link this package. Keep `react-native-device-info` up-to-date to collect the latest device names using your app.**
>
> Since v3, support for accessing the DeviceInfo has been abstracted into an interface ```IDeviceInfoModule``` to enable you to use / set your own device info module. This interface uses the same function names and result `react-native-device-info`.

> Note for Expo Users: If you are using Expo, which does not support the react-native-device-info package, you have an alternative option. You can use the React Native Manual Device Plugin instead. Please refer to the [`README-manual`](./README-manual.md) for further details on how to integrate it.

```zsh
npm install --save @microsoft/applicationinsights-react-native @microsoft/applicationinsights-web
npm install --save react-native-device-info
react-native link react-native-device-info
```


## Initializing the Plugin

To use this plugin, you only need to construct the plugin and add it as an `extension` to your existing Application Insights instance.

```ts
import { ApplicationInsights } from '@microsoft/applicationinsights-web';
import { ReactNativePlugin } from '@microsoft/applicationinsights-react-native';

var RNPlugin = new ReactNativePlugin();
var appInsights = new ApplicationInsights({
    config: {
        instrumentationKey: 'YOUR_INSTRUMENTATION_KEY_GOES_HERE',
        extensions: [RNPlugin]
    }
});
appInsights.loadAppInsights();
```

### Disabling automatic device info collection

```ts
import { ApplicationInsights } from '@microsoft/applicationinsights-web';

var RNPlugin = new ReactNativePlugin();
var appInsights = new ApplicationInsights({
    config: {
        instrumentationKey: 'YOUR_INSTRUMENTATION_KEY_GOES_HERE',
        disableDeviceCollection: true,
        extensions: [RNPlugin]
    }
});
appInsights.loadAppInsights();
```

### Using your own device info collection class

```ts
import { ApplicationInsights } from '@microsoft/applicationinsights-web';

// Simple inline constant implementation
const myDeviceInfoModule = {
    getModel: () => "deviceModel",
    getDeviceType: () => "deviceType",
    // v5 returns a string while latest returns a promise
    getUniqueId: () => "deviceId",         // This "may" also return a Promise<string>
};

var RNPlugin = new ReactNativePlugin();
RNPlugin.setDeviceInfoModule(myDeviceInfoModule);

var appInsights = new ApplicationInsights({
    config: {
        instrumentationKey: 'YOUR_INSTRUMENTATION_KEY_GOES_HERE',
        extensions: [RNPlugin]
    }
});

appInsights.loadAppInsights();
```
## Requirements
You must be using a version `>=2.0.0` of `@microsoft/applicationinsights-web`. This plugin will only work in react-native apps, e.g. it will not work with `expo`.

## Device Information Collected

By default, this plugin automatically collects
 - **Unique Device ID** (also known as Installation ID)
 - **Device Model Name** (iPhone XS, etc.)
 - **Device Type** (Handset, Tablet, etc.)

## IDeviceInfoModule

```typescript
/**
 * Interface to abstract how the plugin can access the Device Info, this is a stripped
 * down version of the "react-native-device-info" interface and is mostly supplied for
 * testing.
 */
export interface IDeviceInfoModule {
    /**
     * Returns the Device Model
     */
    getModel: () => string;

    /**
     * Returns the device type
     */
    getDeviceType: () => string;

    /**
     * Returns the unique Id for the device, to support both the current version and previous
     * versions react-native-device-info, this may return either a `string` or `Promise<string>`,
     * when a promise is returned the plugin will "wait" for the promise to `resolve` or `reject`
     * before processing any events. This WILL cause telemetry to be BLOCKED until either of these
     * states, so when returning a Promise it MUST `resolve` or `reject` it can't just never resolve.
     * There is a default timeout configured via `uniqueIdPromiseTimeout` to automatically unblock
     * event processing when this issue occurs.
     */
    getUniqueId: () => Promise<string> | string;
}
```

If events are getting "blocked" because the `Promise` returned via `getUniqueId` is never resolved / rejected
you can call `setDeviceId()` on the plugin to "unblock" this waiting state. There is also an automatic timeout
configured via `uniqueIdPromiseTimeout` (defaults to 5 seconds), which will internally call `setDeviceId()` with
any previously configured value.

## Nightly Builds

To aid with testing and validation we also produce and publish nightly builds whenever there is a change from the previous build. These builds are published to the [NpmJs registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/applicationinsights-react-native) on a successful build / test pass.

This process also [tags the source code](https://github.com/microsoft/applicationInsights-react-native/tags) so that we can track the specific changes included using a nightly build specific version number which is the format "nightly-yymm-##" eg. ```nightly-2208-02```

These nightly builds will not be retained indefinitely and should only be used for __pre-production__ testing and/or validation of any changes that have not yet been released.

### NPM

The NPM builds are tagged as "nightly" and can by downloaded using this as the version number ```npm install @microsoft/applicationinsights-react-native@nightly``` or using the nightly specific version number which is "nightly.yyyymm-###" (```npm install @microsoft/applicationinsights-react-native@2.7.3-nightly.2112-08```) where ## is the specific build number for the month (Note, slightly different version from the source code tag due to compatibility issues between the different systems).

### Deployment process

When a new release is deployed the following occurs as part of the release

- NPM packages are created and published to [NpmJs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/applicationinsights-react-native)
